# Robot Test

This subdirectory has robot test cases that can be triggered from mvn to run the client/server tests of the gRPC protocol buffers.

mvn clean install

as more reference implementations are built we can add them as test cases and test suites to confirm the protocol design and help explain how the API works through the reference implementations.
